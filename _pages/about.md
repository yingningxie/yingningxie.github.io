Hi, I am Ningning - a `doctoral candidate` at the [Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu), Rutgers University in New Brunswick. I am currently working on my dissertation titled *"E-Cycling for Well-Being: Potential, Realized, and Perceived Accessibility of E-Bike Users in the United States."*

I have conducted research in China, India, Europe, and the United States, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, such as participatory planning, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, geospatial analysis, and statistical modeling. With an academic journey that spans Social Work to Urban Planning and a personal footprint across diverse cultures, I am committed to advocating for an equitable and sustainable transportation system.
